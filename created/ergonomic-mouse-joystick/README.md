## Goals

- Create a removable conversion kit for Logitech G502 mouse
- Create a joystick which can use the mouse M1 and M2 buttons of host mouse
- More comfortable to use than the mouse in normal use

#### Later goals

- Integrated electronics rather than operating host mouse external buttons
- Add functions for scroll and back/forward buttons
- Joystick for arrow keys

Adapter will connect to mouse and joystick. For Logitech G502 there is a small plate with two latches and a magnet that will be easy to reproduce and should be strong enough to connect the parts except for strong sudden moves. Joystick will be static relative to mouse, even removable and kept in place by a spring loaded pin.

Joystick will be kept low to the table for best ergonomics, as well as have a hand rest to prevent hand from rubbing against table or mouse pads.

![Mechanical sketch](./docs/002-rough-mechanics.png)

The joystick trigger will function as M1, possible similar setup for M2, activated by a series of motions:
1. Finger pulls trigger
1. Trigger rotates around fulcrum
1. Fulcrum pulls pull string for M1
1. Pull string for M1 pulls lever for M1
1. Lever for M1 rotates around fulcrum
1. Lever for M1 pushed down on host mouse M1

Lever for M1 will not need to be kept in tension, but trigger might need a spring to reset.
