# Pill Dispenser

Fun dispenser for pills, capsules, vitamins, breath mints, or small candies.

# TODO
- Assembly guide, including instructions on springs or similar (using one from an old click pen might work?) 
- part design, ideally a magazine to hold most normal sized pills, a spring loaded button with a chamber for taking pull from drop magazine down to a delivery chute or basket, one for normal sized pills, one for larger capsules, include small tabs on front so a note or logo or name can be cut out and placed easily on top
- include pill size in description
- a mount for multiple dispensers to be mounted easily (just a small tab/hook along a rail)
- a counter/day index that says "i have taken the pills for x" where x can be moved or rotated to indicated monday, tues etc., can be mounted on mount althought in theory it would be too complex compared to just a 7 slot pill box for alzheimers patients or similar since they would have to know what pills to take and what number... include some sort of paper tab thing for instructions?
