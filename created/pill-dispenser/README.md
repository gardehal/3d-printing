# Pill Dispenser

Fun dispenser for pills, capsules, vitamins, breath mints, or small candies.

# TODO
- Assembly guide, including instructions on springs or similar (using one from an old click pen might work?) 
- a mount for multiple dispensers to be mounted easily (just a small tab/hook along a rail)
- a counter/day index that says "i have taken the pills for x" where x can be moved or rotated to indicated monday, tues etc., can be mounted on mount althought in theory it would be too complex compared to just a 7 slot pill box for alzheimers patients or similar since they would have to know what pills to take and what number... include some sort of paper tab thing for instructions?
- fix tinkercad using cpu (laggy) - sollution was disable hardware accelration in chromium browser, close browser, open, enable, close, open again, then it worked
- fix the blister popper eject hole (too small) 
- how its only going to be one pill in the hole is questionable, the magazine should be designed per pill or capsule but the button and dispenser body can be the same uniform hole, slide or indexing in magazine,
- better way to fit the spring, take into account the compressed size of spring, move input for rails on side of button a little so the button doesnt sit compressed in the exact place where it comes out, spring of a ballpoint pen is fine,
- alternative mechanical dispens method gravity lever, or sideways lever
