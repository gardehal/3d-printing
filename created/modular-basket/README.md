# Modular basket

A basket with modular design. Start with a central node and mix and match modules for whatever you need. Use a M5x15 machine screw and M5 bolt for connecting.

# TODO

- the mid-seam still allows a little dangling
- second screw hole for the bottom for sturdier feel?
- still need to cut down on print times, 10+ hours for central node and 2-cans is a little much
