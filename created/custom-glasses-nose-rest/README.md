# Custom Glasses Nose Rest

A nose rest to put on glasses to spread the weight more evenly, customized to your nose.
Note: the rest itself is not customizable, but this will provide a description on how to do it yourself.

## How to

1. Download and print [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3694367) profile tool to find the specific shape of your nose bridge
2. Measure your nose:
  - At least once vertically with the profile tool, take a picture
  - A couple of times horizontally, 5-10mm apart, taking pictures and keeping track of which measurement is where
3. Upload pictures to your computer and trace along the tool so you can create a shape on a transparent layer that can be transferred to vector image and imported to your 3D modeling software. Example with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/):
  - Import image, File -> Open -> select image(s) - Shortcut: Ctrl + O
  - Use the Paths tool and click on the profiling tool following the shape (the more nodes, the more accurate the shape) - Shortcut: B
  - Once the path is complete, click Paths tab bottom right of the screen (same tab row as layers are on)
  - Export your path as a SVG vector image by right clicking Unnamed -> Export Paths... -> name it something like side.svg -> Save
  - Import vector into your 3D modeling program
  - Optional: Some modeling tools have options to draw a shape using the mouse, this could be useful if your paths are a bit janky, to smooth your estimated shape out.
4. Assemble the imported shapes to recreate an estimation of your nose
5. From this shape, create a nose rest that fits and you can add to your glasses

The same process can be used to make a mock model if your glasses in a 3D modeling program, though the profiling tool is not needed, just take front, top, and side pictures of the glasses themselves.

## TODO

- alternate way of finding nose shape/model, try some camera 3D mapping tool?
