# Custom Glasses Nose Rest

A nose rest to put on glasses to spread the weight more evenly, customized to your nose.
Note: the rest itself is not customizable, but this will provide a description on how to do it yourself.

## How to

1. Download and print [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3694367) profile tool to find the specific shape of your nose bridge
2. Measure your nose:
  - At least once vertically with the profile tool, take a picture
  - A couple of times horizontally, 5-10mm apart, taking pictures and keeping track of which measurement is where
3. Upload pictures to your computer and trace along the tool so you can create a shape on a transparent layer that can be transferred to vector image and imported to your 3D modeling software. Example with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/):
  - Import imgage, File -> Open -> select image(s) - Shortcut: Ctrl + O
  - Create new layer (Bottom right + file looking icon) - Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N
  - Draw your shape on the layer using the Paintbrush tool - Shortcut: P
  - Hide everything else by clicking the eye icon on the original picture layer
  - Export your shape as a vector image, File -> Export as -> Vector - Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + E
  - Import vector into your 3D modeling program
4. Assemble the imported shapes to recreate an estimation of your nose
5. From this shape, create a nose rest that fits and you can add to your glasses

## TODO

- some way to measure each nose (complex curves)
- easy way to attach to glasses
