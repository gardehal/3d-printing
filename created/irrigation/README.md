# Irrigation

Irrigation and water delivery for plants, beds, small gardens.

# Material and print 

Suggest PLA as material due to bio degradability and less toxic materials, though its a plastic and it's microplastic particles will never be good for the water, soil, plants, and ultimately the person consuming any edible plants irrigated.
If using outside or in direct sunlight, PET-G may be a better alternative due to its's improved resistance to photodegradation.

Printing wise this can be done with high layer height which causes more micro leaks through the seams but thats kinda the point anyway, to irrigate the soil.

# Assembly

Male part of tubes goes into Female part of tubes of same size.
Water flows downhill, lay pipes accordingly.

Use the quick-release hose adapters that connect to garden hoses to transport water above the soil. 
If you got no hose in your life and plan to do it all by hand, a funnel might be helpful.

Not tested yet but in theory: 
Pipes should be laid where they shrink as you go down, which allows for a small reservoir that can be filled and the water in it can be left to trickle out through perforated tubes at its own pace.
The tubes under plants and roots should be perforated, but taped up at the top so roots and dirt won't enter and block the pipes.

Example:
```
_____      plant
 \ /        \|/            \|/
 | |------------------------------- soil
 | |         |             /|   
 | |<-40mm  /|\           / |\  roots
 \ \       / \ \         / \ \ \ 
  =============================== <-30mm
```

# Dimension details

## Tube 40mm
- 40mm outer diameter
- 36mm inner
- male top tapers from 40mm to 35.5mm over ~8mm then straight at 35.5mm for ~12mm 

## Tube 30mm
- 30mm outer diameter
- 28mm inner
- male top tapers from 30mm to 27.5mm over ~5mm then straight at 27.5mm for ~15mm 

# TODO
- hose quick connectors (and some way to keep them connected to other pipes so they don't randomly just get pulled up by hose moving- anchor points, large buried part, idk)
- more details on how do plan and lay out pipes, e.g. covering top holes of perforated pipes so dirt doesn't constantly leak in, blocking it, advice on using reservoirs or similar
