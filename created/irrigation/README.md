# Irrigation

Irrigation and water delivery for plants, beds, small gardens.

# Material and print 

Suggest PLA as material due to bio degradability and less toxic materials, though its a plastic and it's microplastic particles will never be good for the water, soil, plants, and ultimately the person consuming any edible plants irrigated.
If using outside or in harsh sun conditions, PET-G may be an alternative due to UV degradation.

Printing wise this can be done with high layer height which causes more micro leaks through the seams but thats kinda the point anyway, to irrigate the soil.

# Assembly

Male part of tubes goes into Female part of tubes of same size.

Use the quick-release hose adapters that connect to garden hoses to transport water above the soil. 
If you got no hose in your life and plan to do it all by hand, a funnel might be helpful.
