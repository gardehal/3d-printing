# Dumb door

Like a smart door, but dumb. Does not require invasive installation.

## TODO

- Structural body that will exert torque on lock and door handle. Should be easy to adjust 3D design for doors with different length between lock and handle.
- Holder for other electronics like PICO, motor driver, power switch, (multicolour) status LED, lock/unlock button.
- API on PICO that receives secure calls over LAN to change lock state. Login/simple user functionality. Some basic stats and logs like last (100?) change datetime and by who, number of lock calls, number of unlocks calls, ...
- Charts and final documentation.

## Circuit diagrams
