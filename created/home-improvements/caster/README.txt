# Summary

Ever had a coaster not dry because they were stacked together in a pile? This tilted coaster set will let your coasters air dry (after you remove the puddle of water that's accumulated) and reduce the chance of getting mold in your coasters. Print two slotted pieces, one connection piece, and up to 4 coasters to complete your set. Choose between the hex coaster or the regular round coaster. All parts are press fitted, no hardware or glue required!

Note: Your printer may leave little ridges on the inside of the slotted pieces. These must be filed away to allow smooth insertion and removal of the coasters.




# Print Settings

Printer Brand: SeeMeCNC
Printer: Rostock MAX
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
Make sure the bed is perfectly leveled before printing. The coasters will need to be flat and not warp. Otherwise, you'd end up with a coaster that rocks and spills your drink everywhere.Parts are made to mill, so there are dogbones in the design that don't necessarily need to be there for printing.
