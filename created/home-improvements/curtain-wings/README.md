# Curtain wings

Foldable panels added to a window frame to block light that otherwise would be let into the room by reflecting in between the window frame/wall and curtains, since most curtains hand freely from above.
Used to lower light level in a room further than curtains could alone.

## TODO
- Need to fix print in place hinge not working anymore
- some way to recude print time? ball join on the end of the wing seems wasteful
