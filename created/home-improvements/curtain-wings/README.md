# Curtain wings

Foldable panels added to a window frame to block light that otherwise would be let into the room by reflecting in between the window frame/wall and curtains, since most curtains hand freely from above.
Used to lower light level in a room further than curtains could alone.

# How to

Measure the average distance from the wall to your curtains, pick the wing width that suits the best and print. Use tape, glue, small nails or screws to attach the wings so they are flat against the wall when folded down. If you have double sided tape, you can bend the legs and stack the wings to apply tape to all of them at the same time, then use a knife to cut the tape between them, saving some time and effort.
Fold up to block light that shines between your window frame/wall and the curtains. 
Tape can be used to block the light gaps between the wings (potential fix coming for this in the print itself). This should be done on the backside, so its hidden towards the wall for aesthetic reasons.
If your window frame goes all the way to the ceiling or floor, its best to start in that end, because it's easier to overlap these wings towards a free corner.

# TODO
- change design to overlap wings to block more light
- smaller/shorter wings for places where full 100mm height wings dont fit
